# Skin Disorder Prediction
This project focuses on predicting different types of skin disorders using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains clinical attributes related to dermatology cases and the goal is to classify them into specific disease categories.

## Project Overview
- Objective: Predict the type of skin disorder based on 34 medical attributes.  
- Techniques Used:Data preprocessing, EDA, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.  
- Algorithms:Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN.  
- Tools:Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
